# Ejercicio_Proyectil
This program is a projectile motion simulator that allows users to input parameters such as initial velocity, launch angle, and gravitational acceleration to simulate the motion of multiple projectiles.

## Installation

You have to make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
You also have yo make sure you have installed this two Libraries: matplotlib, tkinter

  git clone https://github.com/HugoLosada/Ejercicio_planetas
```

- Go to the project directory    

```bash
  cd Ejercicio_planetas
```


Start the server with the command 

```bash
  python Movproyectil.py
```

### Features
Graphical User Interface (GUI): The program features a graphical user interface that facilitates user input and projectile simulation.

Projectile Simulation: Users can simulate the motion of multiple projectiles by entering initial velocity, launch angle, and gravitational acceleration.

Graphical Representation: The program utilizes the Matplotlib library to graphically represent the trajectories of the projectiles.
## Usage Intructions
Choose the Unit System:

Enter "SI" for the international system or "US" for the United States unit system.
Number of Projectiles:

Enter the number of projectiles you want to simulate.
Press "Simulate":

After entering the data, press the "Simulate" button to initiate the simulation.
Results:

Simulation results, including time of flight, maximum height, and range, will be displayed in the interface.
Trajectories Graph:

A window will open with a graph representing the trajectories of the simulated projectiles.
Additional Information:

Detailed information about each projectile will be provided in an additional window.
